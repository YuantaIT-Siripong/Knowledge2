**Answer: YES - Structure is EXCELLENT (95/100)**

Your structure follows industry best practices and aligns perfectly with:
- ADR-002 (Product Documentation Structure)
- BA Lifecycle framework (`docs/lifecycle/ba-lifecycle.md`)
- ADR-003 (FCN Version Activation & Promotion Workflow)

**Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns (specs, rules, governance, validation)
- Comprehensive front matter metadata
- Strong traceability via `related:` links
- Validation automation in place
- Consistent naming conventions

**No structural changes needed.** The repository is well-organized and ready for handoff.
