# Knowledge Base Repository

This repository serves as the authoritative internal knowledge base.

## Objectives
- Single source of truth for business analysis (BA) and solution/software architecture (SA) artifacts.
- Enforced document governance (versioning, lifecycle, recertification).
- Discoverability via consistent taxonomy, metadata, and indexing.

## Structure (High Level)

See `docs/_policies/document-control-policy.md` for governance, and `docs/playbooks/contribution-guide.md` for how to add or update documents.

## Quick Start
1. Create an Issue (label: `new-doc` or `doc-change`).
2. Use the correct template from `docs/_templates/`.
3. Fill YAML front matter completely.
4. Open a PR referencing the Issue.
5. Obtain required approvals per CODEOWNERS/policy.

## Core Principles
- Policy before content.
- Templates for consistency.
- Metadata drives automation.
- Lifecycles differ by role (BA vs SA).
- Decision transparency via ADRs.

## Index
Machineâ€‘readable index lives in `docs/_meta/index.yml`.

## Classification
See `docs/_policies/document-control-policy.md` and `docs/_policies/tagging-schema.md`.
