## Remaining Action Item Detail

### OQ-KPI-001: Time-to-Launch Measurement Window

**Question:** Should Time-to-Launch exclude governance drafting time?

**Impact:** KPI measurement clarity

**Current State:** Metric defined in overview.md but measurement window unclear

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **Recommendation:** Start measurement at spec approval (ADR-003 gate)
- **Rationale:** Aligns with promotion workflow, excludes early exploratory work
- **Document as:** "Time-to-Launch measured from spec approval (ADR-003 Proposed status) to production readiness checklist pass"

**Action:** Update overview.md Section 5.2 with this definition, mark OQ-KPI-001 as RESOLVED

---

### OQ-KPI-002: KPI Snapshot Timing

**Question:** Do we snapshot KPI data before or after nightly ETL?

**Impact:** Data completeness accuracy

**Current State:** KPI defined but data collection timing not specified

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **Recommendation:** Snapshot after ETL completion (more complete data)
- **Rationale:** ETL provides cleaned, validated data for accurate KPI calculation
- **Document as:** "KPI data collected post-ETL (daily 06:00 UTC after nightly ETL completion)"

**Action:** Update overview.md Section 5.2 with this definition, mark OQ-KPI-002 as RESOLVED

---

### OQ-KPI-003: SLA Thresholds for Alerting

**Question:** SLA thresholds for alerting (warn vs critical)

**Impact:** Operational monitoring

**Current State:** KPI targets defined but alerting thresholds not specified

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **Recommendation:** Defer to Monitoring Implementation (Week 7-8)
- **Rationale:** Requires baseline performance data to set realistic thresholds
- **Interim Approach:** Use 10% deviation for warning, 25% deviation for critical
- **Document as:** "SLA thresholds TBD based on 30-day baseline performance data (Week 7-8). Interim: warn at +10% of target, critical at +25% of target"

**Action:** Update overview.md Section 5.2 with interim thresholds, mark OQ-KPI-003 as DEFERRED with owner (Ops) and target (Week 7-8)

---

## Quick Fix Script (Optional)

If you want to resolve all three OQs with recommended approach, update `overview.md`:

**In Section 5.2 (KPI Definitions), add:**

```markdown
### KPI Measurement Specifications

**Time-to-Launch (OQ-KPI-001 RESOLVED):**
- Measurement starts at spec approval (ADR-003 Proposed status)
- Measurement ends at production readiness checklist pass
- Excludes early exploratory/drafting time before formal approval

**KPI Data Collection Timing (OQ-KPI-002 RESOLVED):**
- KPI data collected post-ETL (daily 06:00 UTC after nightly ETL completion)
- Ensures data completeness and validation before metric calculation
- Historical data available for trend analysis

**SLA Alerting Thresholds (OQ-KPI-003 DEFERRED to Week 7-8):**
- Final thresholds TBD based on 30-day baseline performance data
- Interim thresholds: warning at +10% of target, critical at +25% of target
- Owner: Operations team
- Target resolution: Week 7-8 (post-baseline data collection)
```

**In Section 10 (Open Questions), update:**

| ID | Question | Dependency | Owner | Target | Status |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| ~~OQ-KPI-001~~ | ~~Should Time-to-Launch exclude governance drafting time?~~ | ~~ADR-003 metrics scope~~ | ~~Product~~ | ~~Week 2~~ | **RESOLVED** (measure from spec approval) |
| ~~OQ-KPI-002~~ | ~~Do we snapshot KPI data before or after nightly ETL?~~ | ~~Data completeness accuracy~~ | ~~Data Eng~~ | ~~Week 1~~ | **RESOLVED** (post-ETL at 06:00 UTC) |
| OQ-KPI-003 | SLA thresholds for alerting (warn vs critical) | Baseline performance data | Ops | Week 7-8 | **DEFERRED** (interim: +10%/+25%) |
