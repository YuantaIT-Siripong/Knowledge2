**Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns (specs, rules, governance, validation)
- Comprehensive front matter metadata across all documents
- Strong traceability via `related:` links
- Validation automation in place (Phase 0-4 validators)
- Test vector coverage for key scenarios
- Consistent naming conventions

**Minor Improvements:**
- Some documents could benefit from richer cross-referencing
- Integration document is relatively sparse (appropriate for BA scope)

## 3. Open Questions & Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Critical Open Questions (Blockers)

**Status:** ✅ **NO CRITICAL BLOCKERS**

All critical parameters and business rules are fully defined. No blocking questions remain.

---

### 3.2 High-Priority Open Questions (Should Resolve Before Handoff)

| ID | Question | Location | Impact | Owner | Recommended Resolution |
|----|----------|----------|--------|-------|------------------------|
| **OQ-KPI-001** | Should Time-to-Launch exclude governance drafting time? | overview.md | KPI measurement clarity | Product | Define baseline measurement window (recommend: start at spec approval per ADR-003) |
| **OQ-KPI-002** | Do we snapshot KPI data before or after nightly ETL? | overview.md | Data accuracy | Data Eng | Document ETL timing in KPI definitions section |
| **OQ-KPI-003** | SLA thresholds for alerting (warn vs critical) | overview.md | Operational monitoring | BA + Ops | Define thresholds based on baseline performance data |

**Resolution Priority:** Should be addressed during Stakeholder Review phase (BA Lifecycle Stage 4)

---

### 3.3 Medium-Priority Open Questions (Can Defer to SA/Implementation)

| ID | Question | Location | Impact | Owner | Status |
|----|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **OQ-001** | Decimal precision for percentage parameters | domain-handoff-fcn-v1.0.md | Database schema design | SA + DBA | Defer to SA - recommend using DECIMAL(10,8) for percentages |
| **OQ-005** | Clarify memory_carry_cap_count = 0 semantics | domain-handoff-fcn-v1.0.md | Edge case behavior | Product + BA | Document: 0 = unlimited memory accumulation |
| **OQ-008** | Audit trail detail level requirements | stakeholders.md (follow-up) | Compliance implementation | Compliance | Schedule compliance review (Week 7-8) |

**Resolution Priority:** Can be addressed during Implementation phase with SA/Engineering

---

### 3.4 TBD Stakeholder Contacts

**Location:** `domain-handoff-fcn-v1.0.md` Section 2

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

The following roles show "TBD" in the handoff document but have been resolved in `stakeholders.md`:
- Backend Engineer → engineering@yuanta.co.th
- Data Engineer → data-engineering@yuanta.co.th
- Risk Manager → risk@yuanta.co.th
- Compliance Officer → compliance@yuanta.co.th
- QA Engineer → qa@yuanta.co.th
- Front Office Trader → trading@yuanta.co.th
- Middle Office Operations → operations@yuanta.co.th

**Recommendation:** Update `domain-handoff-fcn-v1.0.md` Section 2 to align with `stakeholders.md` contact information.

---

## 4. Conflict Analysis

### 4.1 Documentation Conflicts

**Status:** ✅ **NO CONFLICTS DETECTED**

Cross-document analysis reveals:
- ✅ Parameter names consistent across specs, schemas, business rules, and test vectors
- ✅ Taxonomy codes consistent across manifest, specs, and test vectors
- ✅ Business rule numbering sequential and complete (BR-001 through BR-019)
- ✅ Version numbers aligned across related documents
- ✅ Front matter metadata complete and consistent
- ✅ Related document links valid and bidirectional

---

### 4.2 Schema-to-Rule Mapping Conflicts

**Status:** ✅ **NO CONFLICTS DETECTED**

Validation confirms:
- ✅ All parameters in JSON schema (fcn-v1.0-parameters.schema.json) documented in spec
- ✅ All validation rules (BR-001–004, 014, 015, 019) implemented in parameter_validator.py
- ✅ Business logic rules (BR-005–013, 016) traceable to spec payoff section
- ✅ Governance rules (BR-017–018) aligned with ADR-003 and ADR-004

---

### 4.3 Test Vector Coverage Gaps

**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR GAPS IDENTIFIED**

Current test vectors cover:
- ✅ fcn-base-mem branch (4 vectors): baseline, edge-barrier-touch, ki-event, single-miss
- ✅ fcn-base-nomem branch (1 vector): baseline
- ⚠️ fcn-base-mem-proploss branch: **NO VECTORS** (marked as future scope in manifest)

**Impact:** Medium - proportional-loss mode is non-normative in v1.0, so this gap is acceptable

**Recommendation:** Add comment in manifest noting this is intentional for v1.0 baseline

---

   - Action: Document structure evaluation, gap analysis, handoff readiness
   - Effort: Complete ✅
   - Owner: BA

2. **Document OQ-001 and OQ-005 Resolution Plan**
   - Files: `docs/business/sa/handoff/domain-handoff-fcn-v1.0.md`
   - Action: Either resolve or mark as "DEFER TO SA" with recommended approach
   - Effort: 30 minutes
   - Owner: BA + SA

3. **Create Peer Review Checklist**

**Total Effort:** ~1 hour

---

### 6.3 Nice-to-Have Enhancements (Optional)

**Priority:** P2 - Optional

1. **Expand Integration Document**
   - File: `docs/business/ba/products/structured-notes/fcn/integrations.md`
   - Action: Add request/response examples for API candidates
   - Effort: 2 hours
   - Owner: BA (or defer to SA)
   - **Note:** Current level is appropriate for BA scope; SA will expand

2. **Create Visual Workflow Diagrams**
   - Location: New `docs/business/ba/products/structured-notes/fcn/diagrams/`
   - Action: Add swimlane diagrams for lifecycle events
   - Effort: 3 hours
   - Owner: BA or SA
   - **Note:** Would enhance clarity but not required for handoff

3. **Add More Edge Case Test Vectors**
   - Location: `test-vectors/`
   - Action: Add vectors for boundary conditions (0% coupon rate, single underlying, etc.)
   - Effort: 4 hours per vector
   - Owner: BA + QA
   - **Note:** Current coverage is sufficient for v1.0 baseline

## 8. Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Risks to BA Completion

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Open questions block approval | Low | Medium | Document "defer to implementation" decisions | BA + Product |
| Stakeholder availability delays review | Medium | Medium | Async review via PR comments, set review deadline | BA |
| Schema changes require spec updates | Low | High | Validation automation will catch mismatches | BA + SA |
| Test vector coverage insufficient | Low | Low | Current coverage exceeds minimum requirements | BA + QA |
| Missing peer BA reviewer | Medium | Medium | Self-review acceptable if no peer available, document | BA |

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW**

---

### 8.2 Blockers to Promotion (Proposed → Active)

**BA-Owned Blockers:** None

**Cross-Functional Blockers (Expected):**
- Risk calibration review (Week 7-8) - **SA/Risk Owner**
- Implementation parity confirmation - **SA/Engineering Owner**
- Production readiness validation - **Engineering/Ops Owner**

These blockers are expected and appropriate for the transition from BA-owned specification to SA/Engineering implementation.

## 11. Conclusion & Recommendation

### 11.1 Overall Assessment

The FCN v1.0 BA documentation suite demonstrates **exceptional quality and completeness**. The structure is logical, comprehensive, and well-aligned with established governance frameworks (ADR-003, ba-lifecycle.md). All core deliverables are complete, and the documentation provides clear, actionable guidance for SA/Engineering implementation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Comprehensive business rules with clear priorities and traceability
- Strong validation automation foundation (8 validators across 6 phases)
- Excellent parameter documentation with JSON schemas
- Good test vector coverage for key scenarios
- Clear governance framework and promotion criteria
- Consistent metadata and cross-referencing

**Minor Gaps:**
- 3 open KPI measurement questions (non-blocking, can be resolved during monitoring setup)
- TBD stakeholder contacts in handoff doc (resolved in stakeholders.md, needs sync)
- Proportional-loss test vectors intentionally deferred (acceptable for v1.0)

---

### 11.2 Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED TO PEER REVIEW (BA Lifecycle Stage 3)**

The BA work is substantially complete and ready for peer review. The remaining action items (Section 6.1) can be completed within 1 hour and do not block peer review initiation.
