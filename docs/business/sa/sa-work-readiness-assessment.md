# SA Work Readiness Assessment - FCN v1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

**Question:** From current status, is it possible to do job in role SA?

**Answer:** **YES - with qualifications**

The Solution Architect role **CAN BEGIN WORK** on FCN v1.0 based on the current documentation state. The BA has successfully completed the Domain Handoff Package, providing sufficient information for SA to start architectural design work. However, some SA activities are conditional on resolving specific open questions.

### Quick Status
- ‚úÖ **Ready to Start:** API Design, Data Model Design, Integration Architecture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Ready:** Implementation details pending open question resolution
- üîÑ **Collaborative:** Some decisions require BA/SA joint resolution

---

## 2. Assessment Framework

Based on the SA Document Lifecycle (docs/lifecycle/sa-lifecycle.md), the SA role progresses through these stages:

1. ‚úÖ **Driver Captured** - BA has provided requirements
2. üîÑ **Draft Models** - SA can begin (THIS STAGE)
3. ‚è≥ **Peer Architecture Review** - Future
4. ‚è≥ **Cross-Functional Review** - Future
5. ‚è≥ **Decision Recording (ADR)** - In progress
6. ‚è≥ **Approval** - Future
7. ‚è≥ **Publication** - Future
8. ‚è≥ **Drift Detection** - Future
9. ‚è≥ **Refresh / Supersede** - Future

**Current Position:** SA is ready to transition from "Driver Captured" to "Draft Models" stage.

### 4.2 ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY READY (Minor Blockers)

These activities can start but require **specific decisions** to complete:

#### E. Idempotency Implementation Design
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs decision

**Blocker:** **OQ-BR-002** - "DB vs application enforcement for idempotency (BR-007)?"

**Impact:** Medium - Affects BR-007 (observation processing idempotency)

**SA Actions Available:**
1. Document both implementation options:
   - Option A: Database unique constraint
   - Option B: Application-level locking
2. Create comparison table (pros/cons)
3. Recommend preferred approach

**SA Action Blocked:**
- Final implementation specification

**Recommendation:** SA should analyze both options and make architectural decision, then document in ADR. This falls within SA responsibility and can be resolved without BA.

---

#### F. Historical Observation Replay
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs decision

**Blocker:** **OQ-API-003** - "Should historical observation replay be supported for backdated trades?"

**Impact:** Medium - Affects API design complexity

**SA Actions Available:**
1. Design API with/without replay capability
2. Document complexity and cost implications
3. Recommend approach

**SA Action Blocked:**
- Final API endpoint specification for replay

**Recommendation:** SA should assess technical feasibility and cost, then collaborate with BA/Product Owner for final decision.

---

#### G. Market Data Source Architecture
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs decision

**Blocker:** **OQ-API-005** - "Should market data resource be internal service or external integration?"

**Impact:** High - Affects integration architecture

**SA Actions Available:**
1. Design both architectural options
2. Analyze trade-offs (data sovereignty, latency, cost, reliability)
3. Recommend preferred approach

**SA Action Blocked:**
- Final integration architecture specification

**Recommendation:** This is a core SA responsibility. SA should analyze options and make architectural decision based on organizational constraints, then document in ADR.

---

### 4.3 üîÑ COLLABORATIVE (Requires BA/SA Joint Work)

These items require **joint resolution** between BA and SA:

#### H. Contract Amendment Support
**Status:** üîÑ Collaborative decision

**Item:** **OQ-API-001** - "Should contract amendments be supported in v1.0 (PUT /contracts/{id})?"

**Impact:** High - Affects API scope, data model, business rules

**Why Collaborative:**
- Business implications (trade amendment policies)
- Technical complexity (audit trail, validation)
- Regulatory considerations

**Recommendation:** 
1. SA provides technical assessment (complexity, effort, risk)
2. BA provides business justification and rules
3. Product Owner makes final scope decision
4. Document decision in ADR

---

## 10. Conclusion

### Answer to Original Question

**"From current status, is it possible to do job in role SA?"**

**YES.** The SA role **CAN and SHOULD begin work immediately.**

### Rationale

1. **Sufficient Information:** The BA Domain Handoff Package provides all necessary inputs for SA to start architectural design.

2. **Clear Scope:** Business requirements, rules, and processes are well-defined.

3. **Minor Blockers Only:** Open questions are either:
   - Within SA authority to resolve (OQ-BR-002, OQ-API-005)
   - Can be worked around while awaiting decision (OQ-API-003, OQ-API-001)

4. **Standard Stage Transition:** Moving from BA handoff to SA draft models is the expected workflow per SA lifecycle.

### Recommendation

**The SA should:**
1. ‚úÖ **Immediately begin** Phase 1 work (API design, data model, integration architecture)
2. ‚úÖ **Resolve** architectural decisions within SA authority (OQ-BR-002, OQ-API-005)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Collaborate** with BA/PO on scope decisions (OQ-API-001, OQ-API-003)
4. ‚úÖ **Document** all decisions in ADRs for transparency
5. ‚úÖ **Maintain** regular communication with BA to clarify any ambiguities

**There is no reason to wait.** The current documentation state fully enables SA work to proceed.
